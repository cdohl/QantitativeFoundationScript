    "The weight of a body is the force that the body exerts on the scale when it comes into contact with it. So a weight of 981 N is the force that a body with a mass of 100kg exerts on a scale. In principle, the scale consists of a spring that exerts such a strong force that the weight comes to rest. In common parlance and on scales, the weight is not expressed in Newtons, but in kilograms. As you will see below, this convention only really makes sense on earth and in an unaccelerated reference system.\n",

We feel heavier in an elevator, accelerating in the opposite direction to the earth.\n",
